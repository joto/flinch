Flinch TODO
-----------

- report for walk phase?
- cookie support?
  I needed cookies so I added the following line:

  use HTTP::Cookies;
  sub init_user_agent {
    $ua->cookie_jar(HTTP::Cookies->new);
  }
- interne links auch checken und per mail reporten?
- optionally warn if documents have changed
- user/pass support
- timeout should be in 3m4s format
- handling for 300/multi and 406/not acceptable is unclear
- optionally respect robots.txt
- there should be a manual override for the level. i.e. redirects which are
  really ok, should be marked as such
- create config.xml if it is not there in init task
- document home/remote use
- applet code= do the right thing if jar file is used
- maybe check mailto links? https links?
- save context (especially stuff between <a> and </a>) for references
  maybe line numbers for source code
- check page contents for major changes
