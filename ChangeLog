Flinch ChangeLog
----------------

1.0.6 2008-05-03
  Modifications by Peter Kleiweg:
	* option -v as incremental: -v -v lists LINK on check
	* sorting of report: first by State, second by Link
	* treat dead internal links as external links, display in pink at top of report

1.0.5 [released 2001-12-10]
  * workaround from 1.0.4 didn't work everywhere. Flinch has been changed
    to not use Digest::MD5 any more which should solve the problem once and
    for all.

1.0.4 [released 2001-12-09]
  * workaround for a bug in older Perl/newer Digest::MD5 versions
  * Check return code of close for XML files to detect errors that would
    result in loss of config files
  * New option --short for report generation which excludes 'ok' links from
    report

1.0.3
  * New reportprefix config option used when running walk and report phase
    on different hosts. See documentation
  * Flinch will now note the duration a request takes and show it in the
    report.
  * Some cosmetic changes to the report and mail
  * When using the skip function with suffix match, everything in a URL
    after the first ? is ignored
  * Last-modified header is saved in 'lastmod' element and the report will
    print the last modified time.

1.0.2
  * Some small bugfixes. Flinch should never die while getting web pages.

1.0.1
  * fixed small bug that would print some internal Perl hex code as a removed
    orphaned link
  * new --head option to force useing HEAD requests for all links

1.0.0 [released 2001-06-29]
  * first release
