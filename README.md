# The Flinch link checker

https://github.com/joto/flinch

Flinch is a powerful and flexible web link checker that will make your life
as a web designer or web server admin easier. Flinch is implemented in Perl
and released under the GPL (GNU General Public License). It can be used to
check all the external links on your web pages periodically and produce HTML
reports of its findings. If a web resource at the end of a link has not been
reachable for a few days, Flinch can send you an email.

For installation instructions see the HTML documentation in the doc directory.

## Prerequisites

Flinch needs the Perl modules XML::Generator, XML::Parser::PerlSAX,
HTML::LinkExtor, LWP::UserAgent, URI, Digest::MD5, and HTTP::Status from
[CPAN](https://www.cpan.org/).

On Debian/Ubuntu systems you can install the following packages:

```
apt install libxml-generator-perl libxml-perl liburi-perl libdigest-md5-perl \
            libwww-perl libhttp-message-perl
```
