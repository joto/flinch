    <a name="intro" id="intro"><h2>0. Introduction</h2></a>

    <p>
      <em>Flinch</em> is a powerful and flexible web link checker that will
      make your life as a web designer or web server admin easier.
      <em>Flinch</em> is implemented in
      <a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a> and released under the
      <a href="#license">GPL</a> (GNU General Public License).
      It can be used to check all the external links on your web pages
      periodically and produce HTML reports of its findings. If a web
      resource at the end of a link has not been reachable for a few days,
      <em>Flinch</em> can send you an email.
    </p>

    <a name="install" id="install">
      <h2>1. Installing <em>Flinch</em></h2>
    </a>

    <p>
      <em>Flinch</em> needs the Perl modules <tt>XML::Generator</tt>,
      <tt>XML::Parser::PerlSAX</tt>, <tt>HTML::LinkExtor</tt>,
      <tt>LWP::UserAgent</tt>, <tt>URI</tt>, <tt>Digest::MD5</tt>, and
      <tt>HTTP::Status</tt> from <a href="http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a>.
      If you don't know which modules are installed on your system, it is
      probably easiest to just start <em>Flinch</em> and then install all
      the modules for which you get an error message.
    </p>
    <p>
      To install <em>Flinch</em> you have to follow these steps:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Unpack the tar archive (<b>flinch-VERSION.tar.gz</b>)</li>
      <li>Copy the programm <b>flinch</b> to somewhere in your path</li>
      <li>The documentation is in the <b>doc</b> directory and consists
          of a HTML file and a style sheet. You can copy them anywhere, but
	  make sure that both files are in the same directory.</li>
      <li>Create a directory <b>.flinch</b> in your HOME directory and
          copy the file <b>example-config.xml</b> into it, renaming it to
	  <b>config.xml</b>. Edit the file to suite your needs.</li>
      <li>Create a new project as explained in
          <a href="#init">chapter 4</a></li>
   </ul>

      <h2>2. Starting <em>Flinch</em></h2>
    </a>

    <p>
      <em>Flinch</em> is started from the command line, with the first
      argument specifying the task Flinch should perform. The following
      table shows the available tasks:

      line. Some tasks have special options, but the following options are
      interpreted by most tasks:

      </table>
    </div>

    <a name="config" id="config"><h2>3. Configuration</h2></a>

    <p>
      All the configuration for <em>Flinch</em> is read
      from XML files. <em>Flinch</em> will look for
      these files in in the <b>~/.flinch</b> directory by default. You can
      change the directory with the <b>--configdir</b> (or&nbsp;<b>-c</b>)
      option.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main config file is called <b>config.xml</b>. Every set of web
      pages that you want <em>Flinch</em> to check is called a <b>project</b>
      and each projects configuration is stored in a <b>project file</b>,
      named <b><i>PROJECT-NAME</i>.xml</b> in the same directory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project file is more than a config file:
      When <em>Flinch</em> is running the <b>walk</b> and
      <b>check</b> tasks it will add all the information gathered to the
      project file. In addition, <em>Flinch</em> will note
      the last time it ran the <b>walk</b>, <b>check</b>, <b>report</b> and
      <b>mail</b> task to the file.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main config file will only be read and never written to by
      <em>Flinch</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main config and the project XML files can be edited at any time.
      Subsequent runs of the program will read the changed information and
      act accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is a complete list of all available configuration settings in
      alphabetical order:

    </div>

    <a name="init" id="init"><h2>4. Creating a new project</h2></a>

    <p>
      To create a new project call <em>Flinch</em> with the <b>init</b>
      task:
    </p>
    <p class="example">
      $ flinch init <i>project-name</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Flinch</em> will then ask you a few questions
      about the new project. The answers to these questions will be written
      into a new project file named <b><i>PROJECT-NAME</i>.xml</b> in the
      <em>Flinch</em> directory.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Flinch</em> needs at least the following
      information to create a new project:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>The project name</dt>
      <dd>
        If the project name was not given on the command line,
	<em>Flinch</em> will ask for it. The project
	name can only consist of lower case letters, numbers, the underscore
	and the hyphen.
	This will be stored in the <b>project</b> config variable.
      </dd>
      <dt>The prefix for all your web pages</dt>
      <dd>
        This is something like <tt>http://www.example.com/</tt> or
	<tt>http://www.example.org/~foo/bar</tt>. All web pages with this
	prefix will be recognized as local pages. All other web pages are
	external.
	This will be stored in the <b>prefix</b> config variable.
      </dd>
      <dt>The start URL</dt>
      <dd>
        This must be given relative to the prefix. It is the URL where
	<em>Flinch</em> should start crawling your web
	site to check all
	internal links and get the list of all external links. An example
	would be <tt>/index.html</tt> which would make the whole URL
	<tt>http://www.example.org/~foo/bar/index.html</tt>.
	This will be stored in the <b>starturl</b> config variable.
      </dd>
      <dt>Directory for the HTML report</dt>
      <dd>
        This is where all HTML report files will be stored. This directory
        must exist. Example: <tt>/var/www/flinch/foo</tt>.
	This will be stored in the <b>reportdir</b> config variable.
      </dd>
      <dt>URL for the HTML report directory</dt>
      <dd>
        This is the URL corresponding to the directory named in the last
	step. Example: <tt>http://localhost/flinch/foo</tt>.
	This will be stored in the <b>reporturl</b> config variable.
      </dd>
      <dt>Your email address</dt>
      <dd>
        Your email address is needed to send you reports.
	This will be stored in the <b>email</b> config variable.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
      <em>Flinch</em> will offer a default value for some
      options. Just press RETURN if you want to accept the default.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the other configuration data will use defaults unless you
      change the projects XML file to say different.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last step in creating a new project is copying the
      <b>flinch-style.css</b> CSS style sheet file into the report directory.
      Otherwise the reports will look quite bland.
    </p>


    <a name="walk" id="walk"><h2>5. Walking your site</h2></a>

    <p>
      After setting up a new project the next step is to crawl your site
      to find all your HTML pages and check all internal links. This can
      be done with
    </p>
    <p class="example">
      $ flinch walk <i>project-name</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      You can and should repeat this step whenever your web pages change.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Flinch</em> will report immediately if you have some internal
      broken links, but it will not check external links at this step.
      External links are only recorded in the project file. If you create
      your web pages offline, on a notebook computer for instance, you can
      still run this step, because no external pages will be accessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      By default <em>Flinch</em> will check all internal links, i.e. it
      will get all internal web pages, images, style sheets, etc. All resources
      of type 'text/html' will be checked for internal links and these
      links will be followed. You can use the &lt;skip&gt; element in the
      project XML file to modify this behaviour on a URL-by-URL-basis. See
      the <a href="#config">chapter on project configuration</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that <em>Flinch</em> does <b>not</b> respect a <b>robots.txt</b>
      file on the site you are crawling, because, as a rule, the
      <b>robots.txt</b> file is designed to protect you from foreign
      robots, not necessarily from your own. <em>Flinch</em> is designed for
      use on your own site, where you hopefully know what you are doing.
      Use the &lt;skip&gt; element in the projects file, if you want to
      block parts of your site like CGIs or other dynamic content.
      <b>Don't crawl foreign sites with <em>Flinch</em> without the
      permission of the owner!</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      If <em>Flinch</em> is interrupted by a signal while walking your site,
      the project XML file is not written.
    </p>


    <a name="check" id="check"><h2>6. Checking external links</h2></a>

    <p>
      After crawling your site, and periodically thereafter, you should check
      all external links by calling <em>Flinch</em> as follows:
    </p>
    <p class="example">
      $ flinch check <i>project-name</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      When called with the <b>check</b> task, <em>Flinch</em> will
      loop over all external links and try to get the named resources. With
      the following options you can restrict which links should be checked.
    </p>
    <div class="center">
      <table cellpadding="4" border="0" cellspacing="1" width="100%">
        <tr>
          <th>Long/short option</th>
          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>--head, -h</td>
          <td>
	    Force usage of HEAD request, even if a HEAD request failed
	    before. If you started a check when your Internet connection
	    was down and all checks failed, all links will be marked
	    "don't try a HEAD request next time". This option will clear

      </table>
    </div>
    <p>
      For instance,
    </p>
    <p class="example">
      $ flinch check -l error <i>project-name</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      will only check links that had some error the last time they were
      checked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result of the check will be written to a &lt;result&gt; element
      in the project XML file. Various information, like the time the
      check was performed, the HTTP return code, etc. will be stored in the
      attributes of the &lt;result&gt; element.
    </p>
    <p>
      Together, all the &lt;result&gt; elements for a link make up its
      <b>history</b>. The history is kept in the XML file. By default the
      history is only kept back to the last time a positive response was
      received. This can be changed with the <b>keep</b> attribute to
      the &lt;history&gt; element.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each check will first be tried with the HEAD method. If the check
      fails, a GET request will be used. Unfortunately many servers
      return bogus error messages when the HEAD method is used, so we have to
      try GET. <em>Flinch</em> will keep track of all
      servers where the HEAD request failed and use a GET request directly
      the next time the link is checked.
    </p>
    <p>
      If <em>Flinch</em> is interrupted by a signal while checking the
      external links, the project XML file is written with the current status,
      i.e. some of the links will have a new check entry and some don't. If
      a SIGHUP is received, the current state is written to the project XML
      file and the checking continues. Note that it might take a moment for
      the signal to register, because a currently running check of a link
      is not interrupted.
    </p>

    <a name="report" id="report"><h2>7. Creating a HTML report</h2></a>

    <p>
      To create a HTML report from the current state of the XML file, use
      the <b>report</b> task. The report consists of an overview page
      and, for every external link, a page with all the details. If the
      option <b>--short</b> is used, a short report will be generated
      containing only links not in the 'ok' state.
    </p>
    <p>
      The overview will show a list of all external links, the date the
      last check for this links was performed, the result of that check,
      the URL and a <b>Details</b> link to open the detailed information for
      this link.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is a list of states a link can be in:

    <a name="edit" id="edit"><h2>9. Editing the project file</h2></a>

    <p>
      You can edit the project XML file whenever you want. Changes will
      be reflected the next time you run <em>Flinch</em>.
      To make your life a little bit easier, you can call
      <em>Flinch</em> as follows to edit a projects file:
    </p>
    <p class="example">
      $ flinch edit <i>project-name</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      This will open an editor and load the project file into it.
      <em>Flinch</em> will use the content of the
      <b>XMLEDITOR</b> or,
      if not found, the content of the <b>EDITOR</b> environment variable
      to decide which editor to start. If both variables are not set,
      <b>vi</b> will be started.
    </p>

    <a name="reg" id="reg"><h2>10. Running <em>Flinch</em> regularly</h2></a>

    <p>
      Most people want to run the <b>check</b> and <b>mail</b> tasks
      regularly and automatically by <b>cron</b>. On the other hand,
      <b>cron</b> might be too regular - you might just hit a web site's
      maintenance interval every day and thus get the impression that the
      page is "always down" when in fact it is only down for five minutes
      a day.  To work around this, you can use the <b>--time</b> option
      of <em>Flinch</em>:
    </p>
    <p>
      Call <em>Flinch</em> every hour from <b>cron</b>, but use e.g.
      <b>--time=21</b> to request it run every 21 hours. <em>Flinch</em>
      will be started every hour, but if less than 21 hours have elapsed
      since it last ran it will quit immediately. The effect is, that the
      real check time will be different every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <b>walk</b> task should be run whenever your web pages change. The
      <b>report</b> task can either be run regularly after the <b>check</b>
      task or whenever you want to have a look at the HTML report.
    </p>

    <a name="xml" id="xml"><h2>Appendix A. The XML files</h2></a>

    <p>
      For some "advanced" configuration you have to edit the XML files. This
      is not as difficult as it might seem, as the file format is mostly
      self-explanatory. This appendix will explain the details.
    </p>
    <p>
      The is a DTD (<b>flinch.dtd</b>) included in the distribution, but
      <em>Flinch</em> currently does not use a validating parser.
    </p>
    <p>
      The XML config and project files have a similar layout. Both use the
      same DTD (<b>flinch.dtd</b>) and have &lt;flinch&gt; as the root
      element. Here is the general layout:
    </p>

    <div class="xml">
  &lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
  &lt;!DOCTYPE flinch SYSTEM "flinch.dtd"&gt;
  &lt;flinch&gt;
    &lt;config&gt;
      ...
    &lt;/config&gt;
    &lt;last ... /&gt;
    &lt;skip&gt;
      ...
    &lt;/skip&gt;
    ...
    &lt;link&gt;
      ...
    &lt;/link&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/flinch&gt;
    </div>

    <p>
      The &lt;config&gt; section appears in both the main config file and
      the project files. All other sections can only exist in the project
      files. The &lt;skip&gt; and the &lt;link&gt; elements can be repeated
      as often as needed.
    </p>

    <h3>A.1 The &lt;config&gt; element</h3>

    <p>
      Both the <b>config.xml</b> and the project files contain a
      &lt;config&gt; section. The <b>config.xml</b> file sets the defaults
      for some config variables, the project files can overwrite settings
      and add new ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &lt;config&gt; section generally looks like this:
    </p>

    <div class="xml">
  &lt;config&gt;
    &lt;timeout&gt;<b>30</b>&lt;/timeout&gt;
    &lt;schemes&gt;<b>http ftp</b>&lt;/schemes&gt;
    &lt;project&gt;<b>foo</b>&lt;/project&gt;
    &lt;prefix&gt;<b>http://www.example.com/foo</b>&lt;/prefix&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/config&gt;
    </div>
    <p>
      See <a href="#config">the configuration section</a> for a list of
      config elements.
    </p>


    <h3>A.2 The &lt;last&gt; element</h3>

    <p>
      <em>Flinch</em> uses the &lt;last&gt; element
      to store the times it last ran the <b>walk</b>, <b>check</b>,
      <b>report</b> and <b>mail</b> tasks. This is needed for the
      <tt>--time</tt> option to work. The time is given in seconds since
      the epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC). The element looks like this:
    </p>
    <div class="xml">
  &lt;last mail="<b>993676544</b>" report="<b>993647646</b>" check="<b>993677548</b>" walk="<b>993671490</b>" /&gt;
    </div>

    <h3>A.3 The &lt;skip&gt; element</h3>

    <p>
      &lt;skip&gt; elements can be used to restrict which pages <em>Flinch</em>
      will access. The <b>type</b> attribute ('prefix', 'suffix', 'regex',
      'url') together with the content of the &lt;skip&gt; element specifies
      which URLs should be excluded. If the 'suffix' attribute is used,
      everything after an optional '?' in the URL is ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <b>action</b> attribute specifies which action to take if the
      URL matches. An action of <tt>ignore</tt> means not to get the
      resource. <tt>nofollow</tt> means that the resource should be checked,
      but links on the page should not be followed. <tt>nofollow</tt> is
      the default.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few examples:
    </p>

    <div class="xml">
  &lt;skip action="<b>nofollow</b>" type="<b>suffix</b>"&gt;<b>.shtml</b>&lt;/skip&gt;
  &lt;skip action="<b>ignore</b>" type="<b>prefix</b>"&gt;<b>http://www.example.org/</b>&lt;/skip&gt;
  &lt;skip type="<b>url</b>"&gt;<b>http://www.example.com/cgi-bin/test.cgi</b>&lt;/skip&gt;
    </div>

    <h3>A.3 The &lt;link&gt; element</h3>

    <p>
      For each external link that <em>Flinch</em> encountered in the
      <b>walk</b> phase, there is a &lt;link&gt; element in the project
      file. The <b>to</b> attribute contains the URL of the link's
      destination. For every local URL that has a link to the external
      URL, there is a &lt;ref&gt; element. The responses to the last
      checks are stored in the &lt;history&gt; elements described in the
      next section.
    </p>

    <div class="xml">
  &lt;link to"<b>http://www.example.com/</b>"&gt;
    &lt;ref&gt;<b>http://localhost/example.html</b>&lt;/ref&gt;
    &lt;ref&gt;<b>http://localhost/another.html</b>&lt;/ref&gt;
    &lt;history&gt;
      ...
    &lt;/history&gt;
  &lt;/link&gt;
    </div>

    <h3>A.4 The &lt;history&gt; element</h3>

    <p>
      The &lt;history&gt; element and its sub-elements are used to save the
      responses
      to the last checks. By default all responses up to the last successful
      response will be stored. The <b>keep</b> attribute of the
      &lt;history&gt; element can be used to configure a maximum number of
      responses to keep. Setting this to <b>"0"</b> or not setting it at all
      will result in the default behaviour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is an example history section:
    </p>
    <div class="xml">
  &lt;history keep="<b>8</b>"&gt;
    &lt;check state="<b>timeout</b>" message="<b>Can't connect to www.example.com:80 (Timeout)</b>" time="<b>993328622</b>" /&gt;
    &lt;check state="<b>redirect</b>" location="<b>http://www.example.net/</b>" code="<b>302</b>" time="<b>993328382</b>" /&gt;
    &lt;check state="<b>ok</b>" code="<b>200</b>" time="<b>993288402</b>" duration="<b>0.3</b>" lastmod="<b>993278402</b>" /&gt;
  &lt;/history&gt;
    </div>
    <p>
      Here <b>time</b> is the time in seconds since the epoch (1970-01-01
      00:00:00 UTC) when the check was performed. <b>state</b> is the state
      of this check. The HTTP response code is stored in <b>code</b>. The
      <b>location</b> attribute is used to store a new location for a
      <b>redirect</b> response. If there is any user readable message, it
      is supplied in <b>message</b>. The duration of the request in seconds
      is stored in <b>duration</b>. If the server supplied a Last-Modified
      header, the time is stored in <b>lastmod</b>.

      <h2>Appendix C. Using <em>Flinch</em> on two hosts</h2>
    </a>

    <p>
      Some people are editing their web pages not on the web server itself,
      but on a different system. Only when the pages are finished they are
      moved to the real server. <em>Flinch</em> can handle this situation,
      because the check can be run on a different computer from the one
      where the report is generated.
    </p>
    <p>
      To set this up do the following: Install <em>Flinch</em> on both
      computers. On the real web server (S) create the config files as
      described in <a href="#config">Chapter 3</a> and <a href="#init">4</a>.
      The <b>reporturl</b> and <b>reportdir</b> configuration options should
      point to the computer you do the editing on (E).
    </p>
    <p>
      Edit the project XML file and add the config option <b>reportprefix</b>.
      It should point to the place on host E where you are testing your
      pages. It should similar to this:
    </p>
    <div class="xml">
    &lt;config&gt;
      &lt;prefix&gt;http://www.realserver.com&lt;/prefix&gt;

    <p>
      Now copy the <tt>config.xml</tt> file to your editing host (E).
      Run the <b>walk</b>, <b>check</b> and <b>mail</b> phases on Host S.
      Whenever you need a report copy the project XML file from S to E
      and run <em>Flinch</em> there to generate the report. All the links
      in the report will point to your test pages on E, not to the real
      pages on S.
